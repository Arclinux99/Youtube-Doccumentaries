    it's refarely entire internet to agree on something but when it comes to Johnny Somali everyone agrees that he deserves everything that's coming his way and while there's no shortage of obnoxious clout chases on the internet like Jack doy or neon most of them stick to causing trouble in the US Johnny Somali on the other hand has managed to become Public Enemy Number One in multiple countries across the globe over the last couple of years he's done every heinous act you can think of from harassing female cops in other countries

he is disrespecting a statue dedicated to victims of in World War [Music] and much much more, fortunately Kama has finally caught up with him and there's nothing he can do to escape the consequences of his actions this time.

hi I'm the Ultimate MasterTV I create weekly YouTube documentaries and today we'll be going over the deserved and long overdue downfall of Johnny Somali. now for most other creators a downfall means getting cancelled online losing their viewers and Fading Into irrelevance but as you'll see by the end of this video Johnny sali's fate is a whole lot worse however to fully understand how he ended up here we first need to start from the very beginning.
    
    unfortunately discussing his past is harder than it needs to be. information surrounding Johnny sali's origin is all over the place and doesn't help that he's one of the most insincere creators out there willing to make up lies without a second thought, for instance to fully  he has claimed to be a quote former Child Soldier and Somali pirate in the past his real identity is of a 24-year-old Ramy colored Ismail who grew up in Scottsdale Arizona he graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in finance, more importantly despite having Somali in his online name he doesn't have any Somali Heritage.

so the facted that he's tarnishing the Somali name for no apparent reason has left people from the country outraged with one person on Twitter writing.
somalis are not known to act like this animal Somali people are very noble people and hard workers respectful human being although he not Somali and just running around with the title joining Somali, I will still like to apologize to the Korean people that were hurt. that said one thing we know for certain about Johnny Somali is that he's always dreamed of becoming a globe trotting content creat up.

# Second choice:
you go to school for 4 years you go you go work for 40 years you end up in a cubicle with a suit on and a tie getting the same salary as everybody else where's the mobility in life I would rather take a risk and um live a different life you know what I mean live in different countries meet new people and that's why I kind of aspired to start my own business and that's what I did I I ran I ran a vape company for a while I still run it now and um that kind of gives me the freedom and the income to pursue my passion which has also always been content creation but I've never had um the time to do it cuz it's either I was working or it's either I was in school or was either you know what I mean.

And while there's nothing wrong with chasing such a dream it's how you go about it that    
truly matters and as surprising as it may sound Johnny actually started off on the right path, in early 2023 he visited Thailand and started uploading travel Vlogs on YouTube these videos were extremely tame and let's just say normal especially compared to his more recent content however almost all of these were just basic edits of him walking around Thailand trying local food and partying they lacked any real substance and most viewers found them boring and uninspiring resulting in his Channel Growing at a snail's pace.

in May 2023 he had less than 5,000 subscribers despite uploading over 300 videos by that point his dream of making it big was slipping further Out Of Reach with each passing day, something had to change but instead of working on improving his content like any other San Creator would do he took inspiration from the obnoxious antics of ice beside it.

"people of Los Angeles how are you don't mind us I have me I have a mental illness if you come near me you're going to get mentally ill 

and came up with a new plan a decision that would ultimately lead to him becoming the target of a nationwide manh.

It all started with him leaving Thailand and flying to Japan to do iroll streaming on Kick and the shift in his content style was clear from the moment he turned on his camera on his very first day in the country he got on a train and started harassing the person sitting next to him.
# Secoond voice:
youim you know you know why you do this Pearl Harbor 

and when he didn't get the reaction he was looking for he became even more annoying and started shouting at the top of his lungs.

# Second voice

he didn't stop until a korean-american guy stepped in to defend the other passengers and finally shut up him down.

# Second voice

However before he had a chance to reflect on his actions the clip of him harassing innocent Japanese people went viral on the internet and while he received tons of backlash for single-handedly tarnishing the reputation of foreign tourists in Japan with comments like as a black person who wants to go to Japan this guy makes me so angry not to mention he perpetuates the stereotypes of westers in general and seeing how everyone wants to go to Japan now, the Japanese should be more strict of blacklisting individual tourists from entering their country if they behave like this like he should have been immediately locked up and extradited for disturbing the public so badly the attention also brought him thousands of new viewers which was exactly what he wanted, many people hoped that he would stop harassing others after achieving his goal of going viral, for Johnny this was only the beginning, from there he doubled down on being a public nuisance and started doing every obnoxious thing he could think of, from calling Japanese the Mulan language

# Second voice
this is a Mulan language what does it say is in Mulan language what does it say.

to labeling Japanese people as NPCs.

# Second voice

even blasting racist music on a train.

# Second voice 
yo what's up I'm I'm so sorry.

and once again all in hopes of going viral again.
 
# Second voice

during one of his streams he saw the Japanese IRL streamer meowo and ran up to her without a second thought. 

# Second voice
you live right now what you live on what you live on I am live on Twitch twitch yeah I'm on how many viewers you got I have like 2,000 2,000.

Now this would have been totally fine under normal circumstances. However, Johnny was already banned from twitch and by approaching meowo. he was putting her livelihood at risk you twitch doesn't allow streamers to show ban creators on their streams and breaking this policy can result in a permanent Channel ban fortunately Miako quickly realized who Johnny was and walked away, but instead of moving on with his day he started cussing at her for trying to protect her online career

# Second voice
and then turn around yeah byebye [ __ ] bye-bye get banned [ __ ] get banned 
  [ __ ] get banned you don't get banned [ __ ] with me you don't yeah you better walk away.

His rude remarks and confrontational Behavior led to her breaking down in tears before, before ending the streaming,

# Second voice
I'm a dig I'm so sorry guys today I really wanted to have a really great stream.

-------------------------------------------
she later expressed her frustration in a tweet reading we worked quickly with twitch staff to avoid having our account banned I burst into tears because the taxi driver on the way back was so nice I hope he leaves Japan soon I felt   helpless that I couldn't do anything even though he was right in front of me thank you everyone for your concern and while some people mocked her for overreacting like this one person who wrote playing victim that guy didn't do much what a crybaby most were sympathetic to her experience with replies like glad to hear it it's embarrassing this person is from the US I hope they Bann him from Japan and sorry the guy harasses you and the people of Japan more importantly, these instances highlighted just how comfortable Johnny was getting in harassing others for clout he was pushing his luck and the Japanese public wasn't about to let him get away with it, Unfortunately they severely underestimated just how Shameless he could be you see many people had been trying to put a stop to him since the day started streaming in Japan in fact the same day his train clip went viral a Japanese man tracked him down and showed up for a confrontation no problem there no problem it's no problem no no no no we good come hey we
    
    chill chill so by we good we good come on man we good we good but instead of getting physical or trying to intimidate Johnny he simply wanted to talk and to make him realize the error of his ways I peace okay so have a piece or what yeah peace peace and then let's do Peace So I want to your reason why some okay okay somebody give me a money no somebody give me money and they said say it no so I said it on the train you say it can somebody give me money somebody you know donation so who somebody on YouTube and
    
    twitch YouTube comment yeah YouTube comment give me money no they say say it no you understand I understood but right but it's not good he naively believed that a civil conversation would be enough to change Johnny's mind but he couldn't have been more wrong Johnny also got slapped by another Japanese man the very next day for his clan behavior on the train I I hope nobody in the chat was saying weird if I go back whoa who what the stop stop stop stop but even that didn't phas him in the slightest after seeing his refusal
    
    to back down several popular Japanese YouTubers banned together and press Johnny Somali about his deplorable actions never did this to any other IRL what you want say what you did is something that is um disrespectful for the whole Japanese community and that is why Japan is really M don't tell me you are going to drop atomic ball on Japan okay okay the Japanese don't think you a good they all so made him apologize I apologize to the Japanese come on okay okay okay no just say it go man aide Japan go aide I'm sorry we've all
    
    got those habits that just stick whether it's grabbing a drink to fit in at a party or reaching for something just because your hands feel empty for moments like that fume the sponsor of today's video is a game changer fume is a flavored air device designed to give you something better to reach for it's completely nicotine-free has no vapor and comes in non-toxic flavors like crisp mint my personal favorite fume doesn't require batteries or charging so it's always ready to use whenever you need it to sweeten the deal
    
    it's also a third of the cost of most habits making it an affordable and guilt-free alternative think of it as an awesome way to fill in that hand-to mouth fixation without any of the usual downsides plus fume doubles as a Sleek fidget tool with satisfying magnets and clicks perfect for keeping both your hands and mind busy want to try it head to try fume .com/srobiyt scared him enough to go back to Thailand for a few days however it didn't take long for him to make his way back to Japan maybe he thought the Japanese
    
    people had forgotten about him by then unfortunately for Johnny the Japanese didn't forget and he learned this the hard way is dropping Discord right now hop in Discord oh w w What the all you have to say is stop but in Johnny's Twisted Minds these incidents were nothing more than viral clips that brought him even more viewers so he continued on the same path that is until he crossed the line and found himself in the back of a cop car it started with him walking into random warehouses and harassing the people
    
    working there for no apparent reason get get get getting mad bro he's getting activated dog later the same day he went into a restaurant but instead of peacefully eating his meal he kept blasting siren noises from his phone ha hawi hawi ha [Music] H ha ha are how how how Chinese phone and as a YouTube comment pointed out he wasn't just playing some random noise he was deliberately trying to ruin the day of as many people as possible the comment read that siren he played in the restaurant is the one that sounds every
    
    time North Korea files a missile that's heading for Japan's Mainland it's a sound that causes Japanese people actual anxiety so that's why people got so upset this also explains why the cops were called leading to Johnny getting arrested the next [Music] day police what the you what he was charged with obstruction of business which he tried to defend by claiming that the noise came out of his phone automatically but the judge didn't buy any of it Johnny's luck had finally run out he was given a 200,000 Yen fine
    
    which is about $1,400 more importantly he was also deported from Japan and is now banned from ever entering the country again now you'd think that getting deported and banned from a country would serve as a wake-up call for Johnny however from Johnny's perspective he just got away with harassing an entire country for it's essentially a slap on the wrist so he tried his luck once again in early 2024 this time in Israel there he continued being a public menace however the internet as a whole was tired of his
    
    Shenanigans at this point he wasn't getting the same level of attention he had in Japan so he decided to up the enti by attacking the religion of the country he went to the Western Wall in jerus M which is a holy site for Jewish people and started disrespecting it by placing images of the streamer Aiden Ross and the convicted PDF file Jeffrey Aiden Aiden this is you [ __ ] Aiden Aiden Aiden Ross Aiden Ross give Somali a deal talk to Eddie for me [ __ ] Epstein you'll always be one of us we love you you're our King Jew you're one
    
    of us it doesn't matter what you did [ __ ] you're still Jewish you're still one of us we love you unsurprisingly authorities at the site quickly arrested him and later banned him from entering the city again this stunt also got him banned from kick Johnny however quickly moved on to rumble and continued with the PDF file Theme by hitting on underaged girls I'm too young for you guess how old are you I'm 16 it's legal here in Israel going as far as singing about age just being a number and declaring that he would
    
    happily blank a young girl to prison take me to jail police come age ain't nothing but a number you need you need the older man with some money that's what you need I really groom her I'll really groom you I swear to God and as if that wasn't bad enough he then directed his degenerate gaze towards female police officers and stated openly threatening to essay them in public don't touch me I slapped that ass I grab it too Donald Trump told me grab it by the I grab that too stop playing with me I don't give a the cops are already
    
    occupied and didn't give him much attention which only gave him the confidence to harass another female officer a few days later oh you a bad I swear to God you a bad I take you to dinner I swear to God I swear to God I CH your I'll change your life baby baby I'll change your life I promise you you a bad this time however he wasn't lucky enough to escape the consequences not long after his remarks two male officers approached and arrested him on the spot all the while he kept screaming that he was American
    
    as if that somehow made it okay for him to be a total degenerate okay okay okay okay go go what the [ __ ] okayer what are you doing and while he was released from custody minutes after his arrest the Israeli locals were quick to enact their own Justice on him and his cameraman ow [ __ ] hey don't touch me man hey oh [ __ ] the group that confronted him also ran off with his streaming equipment and the people on the internet couldn't have been any more happier he deserves it he has no no respect for anything I see
    
    absolutely nothing wrong with this this also forced him to leave Israel and find a new Target for farming content which brings us to the country that set on making an example out of Johnny Somali South Korea he visited South Korea in September of 2024 and like last time it didn't take very long for the internet to turn against him just days after entering the country he decided to disrespect the statues of Peace by covering himself in baby oil and doing an obscene dance in front of the statue before kissing the statue's lips for
    
    those who don't know the statue of peace is a memorial to Korean women who were forced into slavery by the Japanese Army during World War II but simply he was trivializing and mocking the horror South Korea experience during the war all while broadcasting to an audience that either Didn't Know Better or Worse found it entertaining but instead of showing any remorse for his vile actions he reacted to himself being on the South Korean news he was just happy about getting more publicity little did he know at the
    
    time this news coverage was about to change his life forever as a comment on YouTube pointed out don't be so sure you will get away with this and leave Korea in one piece Koreans don't tolerate that kind of disrespect in the meantime he continued being his annoying self by harassing passengers on buses and Blasting loud music on trains now it's important to note that by this point Johnny was so full of himself bro uh why are you being racist to other people in other countries for money for cloud I've
    
    said it many times I don't give a [ __ ] I have no morals I'm a [ __ ] socio about I don't give a [ __ ] any beating he took became a viral clip to further fuel his quote Success and his encounters with law enforcement ended with nothing more than a slap on the wrist so when viewers warned him about the consequences of being a jackass in South Korea he proudly dared the people of Korea to swing at him swing on the [ __ ] right now I was waiting for him to swing on I was waiting bro I was so I was waiting for
    
    him toit Twitter come to Han is here tonight we're not scared maybe he thought that South Koreans behave like the Japanese where they would confront him about his Antics But ultimately let him go after a discussion and an insincere apology Korean people wanted to show him what happens when you disrespect the culture of a country and harass its citizens this marked the beginning of a nationwide manhunt for Johnny where people would find him no matter where he went and took their time teaching him a lesson in
    
    respect wow finding and pressing Johnny Somali became a national sport for young Koreans with one Korean person writing it's too bad I left Soul just a few weeks before he arrived he was right in my neighborhood and I would have loved to quote meet him now due to the extremely violent nature of most of these encounters I can't show them here but it got to a point where he was being put in his place by different people multiple times a day leaving his face bruised and swollen One South Korean YouTuber even offered a 1 million1
    
    Bounty about $770 for information on his location he had nowhere left to hide but even this wasn't the end of his troubles in November of 2024 Johnny shared a video of him kissing his supposed Korean girlfriend look me and my Korean girlfriend look look look look you see y'all jealous y getting [ __ ] like this the girl in the video was Korean streamer bong bong IRL who had nothing to do with Johnny and the footage he showed was completely AI generated however using AI to create such videos is a massive crime in Korea with up to 7
    
    years in jail time so when bong bong IRL filed a report against him he got arrested almost immediately she eventually decided to drop the charges a few days later probably just to avoid interacting with him in any way however before Johnny could celebrate being free he got arrested again this time for obstruction of business this is because in his early days in carea Johnny visited a Korean convenience store to try the famous instant Ramen but just like he did in Japan instead of respectfully enjoying food he started a
    
    commotion by spilling water all over the convenience store table right to say you should never have throwing noodles at other customers disrespecting exore employee and just being a flood out [Music] Jackass the store didn't beue him legally at the time but seeing him get arrested for the AI generated video gave them the perfect opportunity to file a report which brings us to the present and Johnny isn't doing too well he's since been charged with multiple other crimes including another case of
    
    obstruction of business for when he arrest passengers on the bus if you guys don't know in case you guys haven't been to Korea um buses tend to run on time and if you are in any way delaying the timeliness of a bus that is huge the Korean government has also taken his filming equipment and passport leaving him unable to leave the country and without his filming equipment he has no way of making more money either now we don't have any confirmation yet but according to some sources Johnny could face up to 29 years in prison he
    
    currently awaiting trial for the 7th of March 2025 and while he likely won't get the full 29 years the Korean prosecutors will likely throw the book at him to set an example for other disrespectful content creators like him and most people on the internet are hoping for the same with one such comment reading most respectful Americans would like to see him sent to jail for his disrespectful Behavior letting him off will only encourage further inappropriate actions consequences need to be enacted and enforced looking back
    
    he had plenty of chances to turn things around but he thought he was Untouchable in the end he dug his own grave and now there's no way out of it even if by some miracle he gets deported without jail time his reputation is in the gutter and his banned from all major platforms at this point a comeback as a content creator seems almost impossible and that's for the better
