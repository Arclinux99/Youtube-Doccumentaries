It is rare for the entire web to agree on anything, but when it is about Johnny Somali, there is a general consensus he is getting exactly what he deserves. The web is full of self-seeking agitators like Jack Doy and Neon, but they keep their stunts in the U.S. Johnny Somali, however, has reached the level of being a Public Enemy Number One in a host of countries worldwide in recent years. He has done countless despicable things, such as harassing foreign female police officers.

He desecrated a memorial for victims of World War [Music] and much more. Luckily, karma has finally caught up with him, and there’s no escaping it this time.

Hi there, I'm The Ultimate MasterTV. I create weekly documentaries for YouTube, and today, we’re taking a deep dive into the long-overdue and well-deserved downfall of Johnny Somali. For most content creators, a downfall means getting canceled online, losing subscribers, and fading into irrelevance. But as you'll see by the end of this video, Johnny Somali’s fate  is a whole lot worse. However, to truly understand how he ended up here, we first need to go back to the very beginning.

Sadly, discussing his past is far more complicated than it should be. Information about Johnny Somali’s background is scattered and inconsistent, and it certainly doesn’t help that he’s one of the most dishonest creators out there—fabricating lies without hesitation. For example, he has falsely claimed to be a 'former child soldier' and a 'Somali pirate.' In reality, Johnny Somali is actually 24-year-old Ramy Colored Ismail, who grew up in Scottsdale, Arizona. He graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in finance. More importantly, despite using 'Somali' in his online persona, he has no actual Somali heritage.

The fact that he is tarnishing the Somali name for no reason has sparked widespread outrage among Somali citizens. One Twitter user voiced their frustration, writing:

'Somalis don’t behave like this. Somali people are noble, hardworking, and respectful. Even though he is not Somali and is simply using the name, I still want to sincerely apologize to the Korean people who were affected by his actions.'

One thing we do know for certain about Johnny Somali is that he has always aspired to be a globe-trotting content creator

you go to school for 4 years you go you go work for 40 years you end up in a cubicle with a suit on and a tie getting the same salary as everybody else where's the mobility in life I would rather take a risk and um live a different life you know what I mean live in different countries meet new people and that's why I kind of aspired to start my own business and that's what I did I I ran I ran a vape company for a while I still run it now and um that kind of gives me the freedom and the income to pursue my passion which has also always been content creation but I've never had um the time to do it cuz it's either I was working or it's either I was in school or was either you know what I mean.


Chasing a dream like this is perfectly fine, but how you go about it is what truly matters. Strangely enough, Johnny actually started off on the right foot. In early 2023, he traveled to Thailand and began uploading travel vlogs to YouTube. These videos were incredibly tame—in other words, dull—especially compared to his later content. Almost all of them were simple clips of him walking around Thailand, trying street food, and partying. They lacked depth, and most viewers found them uninspiring and forgettable, causing his channel to grow at a painfully slow pace.

By May 2023, he had fewer than 5,000 subscribers despite having uploaded over 300 videos. His dream of going viral and making it big was slipping further out of reach with each passing day. Something had to change. But instead of improving his content like any rational creator would, he took inspiration from the outrageous antics of Ice Poseidon.

"people of Los Angeles how are you don't mind us I have me I have a mental illness if you come near me you're going to get mentally ill.

That’s when he devised a new plan—a decision that would ultimately make him the subject of a nationwide manhunt.

It all started when he left Thailand and flew to Japan to begin live streaming on Kick. The shift in his content style was immediately noticeable. On his very first day in the country, he boarded a train and started harassing the person sitting next to him.

youim you know you know why you do this Pearl Harbor 


When he didn’t get the reaction he was looking for, he became even more obnoxious, raising his voice and shouting at the top of his lungs.

# Second voice
hirosima nagaki Hiroshima Nagasaki you know why we do to youas Hiroshima Nagasaki with the sory because you just don't know how to behave I swear to God you do again we're going to we're going to do again you understand.

He continued his rant until a Korean-American man finally stepped in to defend the other passengers and shut him down.

# Second voice

Before he could even take a moment to reflect on his actions, the video of him harassing innocent Japanese citizens went viral. While he faced widespread criticism for single-handedly damaging the reputation of foreign tourists in Japan, comments flooded in, expressing frustration:

'As a Black person who wants to visit Japan, this guy makes me so angry. He also reinforces negative stereotypes about Westerners in general. With so many people wanting to visit Japan now, the country should be stricter about blacklisting individual tourists if they behave like this.'

'He should have been arrested and immediately extradited for causing such a public disturbance.'

Despite the overwhelming backlash, the controversy brought him exactly what he wanted—thousands of new viewers. Many hoped he would stop harassing others now that he had achieved his goal of going viral, but for Johnny, this was just the beginning. Instead of backing down, he doubled down on being a public menace, going out of his way to be as obnoxious as possible. From referring to the Japanese language as 'Mulan language' to escalating his disruptive behavior, he fully embraced his role as an online provocateur.

# Second voice
this is a Mulan language what does it say is in Mulan language what does it say.

He even went as far as labeling Japanese people as NPCs.

# Second voice
real NPC activity right now it's hella it's hella NPCs out here this is crazy these are NPCs guys we with the NPCs right now. bro I'm with the NPCs out here I'm with the NPCs out here really with the NPCs hey these are all NPCs bro and.

He then took things even further by blasting racist music on a train.

# Second voice 
yo what's up I'm I'm so sorry.

And once again, all of it was done with one goal in mind—to go viral.


# Second voice
more haters is more views more views is more money but you know what    you know what I say I say the more haters is the more eyes watching the more his eyes watching is the more money you know what I mean thank you for the publicity I love all my haters every single one of my haters thank you so much for watching you know what I mean I love every single one of my haters every single one of my haters every single one of my haters I love every single one of you haters is my MO bro the more haters the better the more viewers the better thank you so much guys.

During one of his streams, he spotted the Japanese IRL streamer Meowo and, without hesitation, ran up to her.

# Second voice
you live right now what you live on what you live on I am live on Twitch twitch yeah I'm on how many viewers you got I have like 2,000 2,000.

Under normal circumstances, this wouldn’t have been an issue. However, Johnny was already banned from Twitch, and by approaching Meowo, he was putting her career at risk. Twitch has strict rules against banned creators appearing on active streams, and violating this policy could result in a permanent channel ban.

Fortunately, Meowo quickly recognized who Johnny was and walked away. However, instead of moving on with his day, he lashed out at her, cursing at her for trying to protect her online career.

# Second voice
and then turn around yeah byebye [ __ ] bye-bye get banned [ __ ] get banned 
  [ __ ] get banned you don't get banned [ __ ] with me you don't yeah you better walk away.


His aggressive behavior and rude remarks overwhelmed her, ultimately leading to her breaking down in tears before ending her stream early.


# Second voice
I'm a dig I'm so sorry guys today I really wanted to have a really great stream.

"She later expressed her frustration in a tweet, writing:  

*'We worked quickly with Twitch staff to prevent our account from being banned. I burst into tears because the taxi driver on the way back was so kind. I really hope he leaves Japan soon. I felt helpless, knowing I couldn’t do anything even though he was right in front of me. Thank you, everyone, for your concern.'*  

While some mocked her reaction—one person even writing, *'Playing the victim. That guy didn’t do much. What a crybaby.'*—most people were sympathetic to her experience. Many responses supported her, with comments like:  

*'Glad to hear you’re okay. It’s embarrassing that this person is from the U.S. I hope they ban him from Japan.'*  

*'Sorry that guy harassed you and the people of Japan.'*  

More importantly, these incidents highlighted just how emboldened Johnny had become in harassing others for clout. He was pushing his limits, but the Japanese public wasn’t about to let him continue unchecked. However, they severely underestimated just how shameless he could be.  

Many had been trying to put a stop to him since the day he started streaming in Japan. In fact, on the same day his train clip went viral, a Japanese man managed to track him down and confront him in person."  

Second voice:
no problem there no problem it's no problem no no no no we good come hey we
chill chill so by we good we good come on man we good we good but.

Rather than resorting to physical confrontation or threats, the man simply wanted to have a conversation with Johnny and help him realize the error of his ways.


Second voice:
I peace okay so have a piece or what yeah peace peace and then let's do Peace So I want to your reason why some okay okay somebody give me a money no somebody give me money and they said say it no so I said it on the train you say it can somebody give me money somebody you know donation so who somebody on YouTube and twitch YouTube comment yeah YouTube comment give me money no they say say it no you understand I understood but right but it's not good 

He naively believed that a civil discussion would be enough to make Johnny change his behavior, but he couldn’t have been more wrong. The very next day, Johnny was slapped by another Japanese man for his disruptive antics on the train.

Second voice:
I I hope nobody in the chat was saying weird if I go back whoa who what the stop stop stop stop 

But even that didn’t discourage him in the slightest. Seeing his refusal to back down, several prominent Japanese YouTubers joined forces to confront Johnny Somali over his disgraceful behavior.

Second voice:
never did this to any other IRL what you want say what you did is something that is um disrespectful for the whole Japanese community and that is why Japan is really M don't tell me you are going to drop atomic ball on Japan okay okay the Japanese don't think you a good.

Seccond oice:
